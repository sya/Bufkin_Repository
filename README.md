The Bufkin Repository
=================

Like most products of Infochimps, the etymology of our library's name can be traced back to a semian influence. According to the DC Comics wiki, Bufkin is a winged monkey from the Oz tales. He acts as Fabletown's librarian and thus is generally found in the cavernous business office, where he both works, sleeps, and apparently reads a good amount.

The Bufkin Repository is the Infochimps office library. We've made a small database that provides access to a catalog of the literature we have available in our office, and also to literature in Chimps' personal libraries that they are willing to lend to fellow Chimps.
