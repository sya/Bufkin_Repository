The Bufkin Repository
=================

Like most products of Infochimps, the etymology of our library has a semian influence. According to the DC Comics wiki, Bufkin is a winged monkey from the Oz tales, Bufkin acts as Fabletown's librarian and thus is generally found in the cavernous business office, where he both works and sleeps. He apparently reads a lot of the books in the library.

The Infochimps office library. A small database that provides access to the catalog of literature available in the small Infochimps library, and also to literature in Chimps' personal libraries that they are willing to lend to fellow Chimps.
