The Bufkin Repository
=================

Like most products of Infochimps, the etymology of our library's name can be traced back to a semian influence. According to the DC Comics wiki, Bufkin is a winged monkey from the Oz tales. He acts as Fabletown's librarian and thus is generally found in the cavernous business office, where he both works, sleeps, and apparently reads a good amount.

The Infochimps office library. A small database that provides access to the catalog of literature available in the small Infochimps library, and also to literature in Chimps' personal libraries that they are willing to lend to fellow Chimps.
